# EV Charging Station GIS

A project for GIS lecture, Uni Konstanz.

This is a GIS application that supports the exploration of EV charging stations in Germany. The EV charging stations are rated by surrounding facilities. 

# Motivation

- EV is becoming popular
- The time for charging an EV is significantly longer than refueling a normal car
- Thus, drivers might need to spend some time around, e.g., a cup of coffee in a Café. (No alcohol!)

# Dataset
